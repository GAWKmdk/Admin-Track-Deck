# MixPanel Tracking and Analytic Template

Sorta based on following the Tuts Plus tutorial for setting up a custom login with role management and flowrouter hooks -- though likely I will modify this more for collecting analytics for sample shopping cart lists and blog_image content with 2 vote overlay buttons testing.  

## It use

To learn how to setup a user tracking and analytics feature for mixpanel.


## Whats to come

- Tables of collection data with roles and permissions 
- Common role management scenerios moving between pages and datasets.

## What this is not

This is not a starter theme, base theme, or UI framework since the login/logout features are not setup, there is no email and the page is responsive for tablet and desktop only.
